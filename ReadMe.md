# Project Setup Guide

## Frontend

### Technologies Used:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (a Tailwind-based component library for faster styling)

### Setup Instructions:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install  # or use bun for faster installs
   ```
3. **Before committing/pushing any changes**, inform the team to review the final results before proceeding.

### Node.js & Bun:
- Install **Node.js** first.
- If you want a faster alternative to `npm`, install **Bun**.

## Backend

### Technologies Used:
- **NestJS** (a progressive Node.js framework)
- **MongoDB** (Non-relational database)
- **Mongoose** (ORM for MongoDB)

### Setup Instructions:
1. The backend setup will be challenging since we are using NestJS.
2. If you want to learn NestJS, feel free to explore its documentation: [NestJS Docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/).
3. MongoDB will be used as our database.
4. We will use **Mongoose** ORMâ€”each team member should familiarize themselves with its usage.
5. The NestJS project is already created with **Yarn** as the package manager (since it is faster than npm).

## Git Workflow
- Learn essential GitHub commands for smooth collaboration.
- **Before any commit/push, notify the team to review the changes.**
